    "### 1. Data Management Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial step when starting any research project should be to set up a data management plan (DMP).\n",
    "This helps you to flesh out, describe, and document what data exactly you want to collect, what you'll be doing with it, and where and how it's stored and eventually shared. \n",
    "\n",
    "A DMP helps you stay organized and reduces the potential for surprises in the future (e.g., due to too limited data storage capacities or unexpected costs).\n",
    "It is at times also required by, e.g., your University or agencies funding research endeavors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Need more Motivation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the public good\n",
    "- DMP and data mangagement standards, make it inherently easier to reproduce code and analysis pipelines built by others, therefore lowering scientific waste and improving efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "For yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are likely the future user of the data and data analysis pipelines you’ve developed, so keeping your file structure standardized removes the need to remember where you've stored specific pieces of data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DMP enable and simplify collaboration; - allow readers/collaborators to gain a quick understanding of what data you'll be collecting, where this data can be found, and what exactly you're planning on doing with it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reviewers and funding agencies like to see clear, reproducible results (can't really ignore their opininons, no?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open-science-based funding opportunities and awards are available to incentivize good practices (for instance, the OHBM Replication Award, Mozilla Open Science Fellowship, and so on)\n",

    "### What to consider in your data management plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Most universities provide templates, tools, or guidance on how to create a DMP, so it is a good idea to check your university's online presence or get in contact with your local library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Goethe University Frankfurt, researchers can use the following tool: [(German) Datenmanagementpläne mit dem Goethe-RDMO](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/)\n",

Originally conceptualized as a standardized format for the organization and description of fMRI data, the format has been extended to encompass other kinds of neuroimaging and behavioral data. Using the BIDS standard will facilitate the integration of your data into most neuroscience analysis pipelines. \n",
