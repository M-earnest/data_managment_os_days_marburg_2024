# Course overview & procedure

Welcome!

In this workshop, we’re going to explore some super helpful tools and ideas to make managing your research data easier. We’ll be looking at GIN G-node, BIDS, and Datalad—don’t worry if these are new to you, this session is perfect for beginner

This workshop content is compiled into a Jupyter Book that you can easily access. Download the book using the button at the top of this page or visit the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/M-earnest/data_managment_os_days_marburg_2024) to explore and download the materials.

He/Him. When contacting me, please refrain from using honoraries and formal language, "Michael" or "you" is fine as long as the content is respectful, fair and constructive (I aim for the same when I reply).
However, please let me know if you have a preferred way of interacting with other folks, including how you would liked to be addressed, your pronouns and the level of formality.

### Gimme the details

Below you will find important details regarding the course summarized in a compact form. Please consult and familiarize yourself with the information presented there prior to and/or within the first few days of the course. 



#### How do I get all the software and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Nah, everything we'll use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or at minimum free of charge and publicly available. 
Why? Because teaching students via [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is just not fair and won't help anyone: students have to obtain licenses or use those from the university (which usually doesn't have enough for everyone), leading to tremendous problems regarding inequity now and in the future. Additionally, [opens-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) can do everything, if not more than [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) and is furthermore usually better supported, tested and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community. 

In order to help you get all the software required for the course, a [comprehensive installation instruction](link-to-setup.html) was compiled.

#### Where is everything?

All course materials (lecture slides, lecture demo notebooks, lab notebooks, homework assignments, etc.) will be available on the [course website](link-to-index.html), i.e. the one you're looking at right now. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are **free to explore, enhance and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up for the entire duration of the course and beyond, ideally to end of the internet. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.  



### Code of conduct

This course has a `Code of conduct`. Please inform yourself about the specifics by carefully reading through the [respective section](link-to-CoC.html).



### How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback

It’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

If you have:

**- questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so either use the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin, the `discord` channel, `e-mail` or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/name_of_repo/issues).

**- a technical assignment question** - come to office hours (after making an appointment) or use the provided communication platform to reach out (e.g. discord, slack etc.). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask (and include error messages when appropriate!). And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.


**- been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start** - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. **That’s OK - we’ve all been there!** IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on `discord`). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, the code you’ve been trying that hasn’t been happening, and/or the error messages you’ve been getting).


**- questions about course logistics** - first, check the [overview](link-to-overview.html) & [syllabus](link-to-outline.html). If you can’t find the answer there, first ask a classmate.

**- something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth** - feel free to post on `discord`, contact the instructors or come to office hours. 

**- some feedback about the course you want to share anonymously** - If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous [Google Form](link-to-your-form)*

*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.
