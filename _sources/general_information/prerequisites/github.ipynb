    "### What's a \"GitHub,\" and why should we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, GitHub is a web-based platform for storing, organizing, and managing projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content is mainly organized in repositories (or \"repos\" for short); these reports can be viewed as being equivalent to a normal directory that you have on your local machine, for, e.g., storing data and pictures.\n",
    "They may contain a variety of file types and nested directories and will be used as a place to store and organize your project files, including code, assets, and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you see the repository for the course template that you'll be working with. Don't worry if that's still confusing to you; learning how to work with Github is best done using a \"learning-by doing\" approach.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version control and collaborative work\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure we've all lost important documents, codes, or progress while working in academia. If you've been doing programming work, you might also have encountered that fixing a bug may lead to other substantial bugs down the line. \n",
    "People generally tend to come up with their own solution for \"project management,\" like maintaining multiple files with different suffixes added, e.g., project_working_copy_1.txt, project_notes.txt,  project_final_draft_3. Another approach involves making a mess out of documents by storing cut or to-be-implemented content in its own sub-section at the end of, e.g., project_draft_4.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github alleviates that problem by making use of \"Git,\" a distributed version control system, which logs each time a change is made to a file. Via the commit system, we can not only maintain different versions of the same file on, e.g., your local system and the connected public repository, but also revert changes that had negative consequences or recover information lost on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git further makes it easy to work with multiple users on the same project, as each user can maintain their local versions and submit their changes to the public directory, which can then be reviewed by the team on quality and compatibility and subsequently be incorporated into the online project.\n",

    "\n",
    "Git can be quite complex, but **we'll only be using the following operations**; for in-depth explanations in video form, click the contained links:\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Forking**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks): Creating a copy of someones repository, that you want to work with. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. For example, you'll create an online copy of another repository under your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Cloning**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-remote): Meaning to create a local copy of an online repository (called \"remote\"s on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Branching**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches): Meaning to create a copy of a project either online or locally, so that you have an isolated copy where you can work without affecting other branches in a repository. Each repository has one default branch, usually called the \"main\" branch, and can have multiple other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Committing**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-commit): A commit is a \"snapshot\" of your repository at one specific point in time. If you make changes to a repository, you'll have to follow up with \"committing\" the changes to save file changes to your Git repository. This does not mean that your changes will be lost if you, e.g., shut down your system; it just means that the version between a file on your system and the logged version in the GitHub repository does not match.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pulling**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-pull): Means simply to update you local repository with the corresponidng online (remote) repository. For, if you or someone else made changes to the online version of a repository, you pull or \"download\" these changes to your local files this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pushing**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/git-push-to-remote-branch): Git push is used to upload a local repository’s content to a remote repository. Meaning that you send your locally committed changes to your online repository.\n",

    "## Git Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**A standard Git workflow may be looking something like this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create a repository**: Create an online repository by clicking on the \"New repository\" button on the GitHub website. Give your repository a name and a description, and select the \"public\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Clone the repository**: To start working with your repository, you'll need to \"clone\" it to your local computer. This will create a copy of the repository on your computer that you can work with. To clone a repository, click on the \"Clone or download\" button and copy the URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "`BASH`: Open a terminal or command prompt and input the following command: `git clone https://github.com/username/repositoryname.`Where username is your user name and repository name is the name of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Gitkraken`: Click on `file,` `clone repo` and input where the repo should be stored on your system as well as the URL to the repo, i.e., `https://github.com/username/repositoryname.`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Make changes**: Now that you have a local copy of the repository, you can make changes to the code. Simply open the files in your editor and make the changes you want, or create new files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Commit changes**: When you're done making changes, you'll need to \"commit\" them to the repository. Committing a change records it in the repository's history and makes it part of the codebase. \n",
    "    \n",
    "`BASH`:To commit a change, run the following commands one after the other in the terminal (replace \"Your commit message\" with a brief description of the changes you made)l: \n",
    "\n",
    "`git add .` \n",
    "\n",
    "`git commit -m \"Your commit message\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Gitkraken`:  Click on `File,` `open repo,` and select the repo containing your changes. On the left-hand side, you'll see the \"file\" overview. Under unstaged files, you can review your changes. Click the green \"stage all changes\" button or right-click on individual files/folders and select \"stage.\" The files will be added to the \"staged\" files windows. Following, provide a name for your changes (commit) in the summary field below and add a short but meaningful description of your changes. Lastly, hit the green \"Stage changes/changes to commit\" button.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Push changes**: Finally, you'll need to \"push\" your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. This will upload your changes to the website so that others can see them. \n",
    "\n",
    "`BASH`: To push your changes, run the following command: `git push origin master.`\n",
